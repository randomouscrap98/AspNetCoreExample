# AspNetCoreExample
An example program detailing how things are done with EntityFramework and AspNetCore

This program requires the Dotnet Core 3.1 sdk: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/3.1

It works best with vscode, but should (maybe) work with Visul Studio

The page that explains the example (somewhat) is: https://smilebasicsource.com/?p=page-20503
